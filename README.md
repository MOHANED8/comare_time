Flight Schedule Program
This program is a flight schedule program that prompts the user to enter a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), and then finds the flight with the closest departure time to the input time.

Features
The program uses an array of struct to store flight departure and arrival times.
The program prompts the user to enter a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and converts it into minutes since midnight.
The program then compares the input time with the departure times of all flights in the array and finds the flight with the closest departure time.
The program then displays the closest flight's departure and arrival times in hh:mm am/pm format.
How to run the program
Clone or download the source code files to your computer.
Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio, etc.).
Run the executable file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).
Future Improvements
Allow the user to select the departure and arrival cities for the flights, and display the corresponding flight information.
Implement a GUI for a more user-friendly interface.
Allow the user to search for flights on specific dates.
Allow the user to book a flight.
