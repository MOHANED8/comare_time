2.The program prompts the user to enter a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and converts it into minutes since midnight.

3.The program then compares the input time with the departure times of all flights in the array and finds the flight with the closest departure time.

4.The program then displays the closest flight's departure and arrival times in hh:mm am/pm format.
